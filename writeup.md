### Reflection

### 1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.

My pipeline consisted of 6 steps:
1. convert image to grayscale
2. apply Gaussian Blur (I used a static kernel size of 5)
3. pass step 2 through the Canny transform in order to detecte edges
4.  

In order to draw a single line on the left and right lanes, I modified the draw_lines() function by ...

If you'd like to include images to show how the pipeline works, here is how to include an image:
